        <br> Being able to code and program was always my dream. My ultimate goal is to become
        <br> a full-stacked developer. Lets get serious, who isn’t? Growing up during the .com era made web
        <br> development a easy choice to get started learning.

          <br>I still haven't found myself but I did discover that its not who I am that matters. Its
          <br>what I do in my journey to discovery that counts. How does the saying go? Its not the goal,
          <br>its the journey. Born and raised in New York City.
